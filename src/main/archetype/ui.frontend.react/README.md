#set($hash = '#')${hash} Frontend Build: React App

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This application is built to consume the AEM model of a site. It will automatically generate the layout using the helper components from the [`@adobe/aem-react-editable-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/aem-react-editable-components) package.

${hash}${hash} Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

${hash}${hash}${hash} `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode by proxying the JSON model from a local AEM instance running at http://localhost:4502. This assumes that the entire project has been deployed to AEM at least once (`mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage` **in the project root**).

After running `npm start` **in the `ui.frontend` directory**, your app will be automatically opened in your browser (at path http://localhost:3000/content/${appId}/${country}/${language}/home.html). If you make edits, the page will reload.

If you are getting errors related to CORS, you might want to configure AEM as follows:

1. Navigate to the Configuration Manager (http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr)
2. Open the configuration for "Adobe Granite Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Policy"
3. Create a new configuration with the following additional values:
   - Allowed Origins: http://localhost:3000
   - Supported Headers: Authorization
   - Allowed Methods: OPTIONS

${hash}${hash}${hash} `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

${hash}${hash}${hash} `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

Furthermore, an AEM ClientLib is generated from the app using the [`aem-clientlib-generator`](https://github.com/wcm-io-frontend/aem-clientlib-generator) package.

${hash}${hash} Browser Support

By default, this project uses [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist)'s `defaults` option to identify target browsers. Additionally, it includes polyfills for modern language features to support older browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer 11). If supporting such browsers isn't a requirement, the polyfill dependencies and imports can be removed.

${hash}${hash} Code Splitting

The React app is configured to make use of [code splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting) by default. When building the app for production, the code will be output in several chunks:

```sh
$ ls build/static/js
2.5b77f553.chunk.js
2.5b77f553.chunk.js.map
main.cff1a559.chunk.js
main.cff1a559.chunk.js.map
runtime~main.a8a9905a.js
runtime~main.a8a9905a.js.map
```

Loading chunks only when they are required can improve the app performance significantly.

To get this feature to work with AEM, the app needs to be able to identify which JS and CSS files need to be requested from the HTML generated by AEM. This can be achieved using the `"entrypoints"` key in the `asset-manifest.json` file: The file is parsed in `clientlib.config.js` and only the entrypoint files are bundled into the ClientLib. The remaining files are placed in the ClientLib's `resources` directory and will be requested dynamically and therefore only loaded when they are actually needed.

## Include this in a directory context of the virtual host you want to restrict and apply a whitelist of IP's

## Here are some examples:
### Regular expressions are used for X-FORWARDED-FOR if your dispatcher is behind a load balancer
# SetEnvIf X-FORWARDED-FOR ^199\.83\.(12[8-9]|13[0-5])\.[0-9]{1,3}$ AllowIP
# SetEnvIf X-FORWARDED-FOR ^198\.143\.(3[2-9]|[4-5][0-9]|6[0-3])\.[0-9]{1,3}$ AllowIP

### Setup a require any section so if any rules in there are matched it will allow them in
<RequireAny>
  ### We make sure the environment variable AllowIP is enforced
  Require env AllowIP
  ### Here are some rules for CIDR ip blocks and single addresses
  # Require ip 192.150.16.0/23
  # Require ip 120.242.180.10
</RequireAny>

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.adobe.aem/aem-project-archetype/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.adobe.aem/aem-project-archetype)

Maven template that creates a minimal, best-practices-based Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) project as a starting point for your website.

## Welcome

* **Contributions** are welcome, read our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Documentation

* **[Archetype Documentation](https://www.adobe.com/go/aem_archetype):** Overview of the archetype architecture and its different modules.
* Following tutorials are based off this archetype:
  - **[WKND Site](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-wknd-tutorial-develop/overview.html):** Learn how to start a fresh new website.
  - **WKND SPA** Learn how to build a [React](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/spa-react-tutorial/overview.html) or [Angular](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/spa-angular-tutorial/overview.html) webapp that is fully authorable in AEM.

## Features

* **Best Practice:** Bootstrap your site with all of Adobe's latest recommended practices.
* **Low-Code:** Edit your templates, create content, deploy your CSS, and your site is ready for go-live.
* **Cloud-Ready:** If desired, use [AEM as a Cloud Service](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-cloud-service/landing/home.html) to go-live in few days and ease scalability and maintenance.
* **Dispatcher:** A project is complete only with a [Dispatcher configuration](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-dispatcher/using/dispatcher.html) that ensures speed and security.
* **Multi-Site:** If needed, the archetype generates the content structure for a [multi-language and multi-region setup](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/administering/introduction/msm.html).
* **Core Components:** Authors can create nearly any layout with our versatile [set of standardized components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components).
* **Editable Templates:** Assemble virtually any [template without code](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/sites/page-authoring/template-editor-feature-video-use.html), and define what the authors are allowed to edit.
* **Responsive Layout:** On templates or individual pages, [define how the elements reflow](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/authoring/siteandpage/responsive-layout.html) for the defined breakpoints.
* **Header and Footer:** Assemble and localize them without code, using the [localization features of the components](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-core-components/using/get-started/localization.html).
* **Style System:** Avoid building custom components by allowing authors to [apply different styles](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-wknd-tutorial-develop/style-system.html) to them.
* **Front-End Build:** Front-end devs can [mock AEM pages](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/uifrontend.html#webpack-dev-server) and [build client libraries](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/uifrontend.html) with Webpack, TypeScript, and SASS.
* **WebApp-Ready:** For sites using [React](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/uifrontend-react.html) or [Angular](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/uifrontend-angular.html), use the [SPA SDK](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-64/developing/headless/spas/spa-architecture.html) to retain [in-context authoring of the app](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/sites/spa-editor/spa-editor-framework-feature-video-use.html).
* **Commerce Enabled:** For projects that want to use Commerce Integration Framework ([CIF](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components)) to integrate with commerce solutions like Magento.
* **Forms Enabled:** For projects that want to use ([Forms](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-forms-components)).
* **Testing:** ready-to-use Functional and UI testing modules, start adding your own tests
* **Example Code:** Checkout the HelloWorld component, and the sample models, servelets, filters, and schedulers.
* **Open Sourced:** If something is not as it should, [contribute](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) your improvements!

## Usage

To generate a project, adjust the following command line to your needs:

* Set `aemVersion=cloud` for [AEM as a Cloud Service](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-cloud-service/landing/home.html);  
 Set `aemVersion=6.5.5` for [Adobe Managed Services](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/tree/master/src/main/archetype/dispatcher.ams), or on-premise.
 The Core Components dependency is only added for non cloud aem versions as the Core Components are provided OOTB for AEM as a Cloud 
 Service.
* Adjust `appTitle="My Site"` to define the website title and components groups.
* Adjust `appId="mysite"` to define the Maven artifactId, the component, config and content folder names, as well as client library names.
* Adjust `groupId="com.mysite"` to define the Maven groupId and the Java Source Package.
* Lookup the list of available properties to see if there's more you want to adjust.

```
mvn -B archetype:generate \
 -D archetypeGroupId=com.adobe.aem \
 -D archetypeArtifactId=aem-project-archetype \
 -D archetypeVersion=26 \
 -D appTitle="My Site" \
 -D appId="mysite" \
 -D groupId="com.mysite"
```

**Note**: Make sure you use at least 3.1.0+ of maven-archetype-plugin ([#400](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/issues/400))

**Note**: To run above command with older versions, you have to use the old `archetypeGroupId`: `-D archetypeGroupId=com.adobe.granite.archetype`

## System Requirements

Archetype | AEM as a Cloud Service | AEM 6.5 | AEM 6.4 | Java SE | Maven
---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------
[26](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/releases/tag/aem-project-archetype-26) | Continual | 6.5.5.0+ | 6.4.8.1+ | 8, 11 | 3.3.9+

Setup your local development environment for [AEM as a Cloud Service SDK](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/local-development-environment-set-up/overview.html) or for [older versions of AEM](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/foundation/development/set-up-a-local-aem-development-environment.html).

### Known Issues

* When running on Windows and generating the dispatcher configuration, you should be running in an elevated command prompt or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (see [#329](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/issues/329)).

* When executing the archetype in interactive mode (without the `-B` parameter), the properties with default values cannot be changed, unless the final confirmation gets dismissed, which then repeats the questions by including the properties with default values in the questions (see
[ARCHETYPE-308](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARCHETYPE-308) for details).

* You can't use this archetype in Eclipse when starting a new project with `File -> New -> Maven Project` since the post generation script [`archetype-post-generate.groovy`](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/blob/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/archetype-post-generate.groovy) will not be executed due to an [Eclipse issue](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=514993). Workaround is to use the above command line and then in Eclipse use `File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project`.
